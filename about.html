            <p>My name is Viktoriya Bardenova, and I am an Honors College student, majoring in BS in Mathematics. I have been fascinated with exact sciences from an early age and Mathematics has always had a special place in my heart. I have participated in numerous Math fairs and competitions. I have represented my elementary school on a national level and was fortunate enough to represent my high school on an international level at the age of 16. I have always been a dedicated and hard-working student and I go great lengths to deliver what is needed from me. My goal is to use my BS in Mathematics to pursue a MS in Meteorology in Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, University of Miami. I am completely fascinated by hurricanes - from formation to spaghetti plots and projected water surges. I suspect living in Florida has even further developed my curiosity about hurricanes, which is perfectly fine as I believe this is just the right place to be more educated on the topic. </p>
            <p>I am currently learning HTML and CSS and you can check out my progress at:</p>
