            <p>My name is Viktoriya Bardenova, and I am an Honors College student, majoring in BS in Mathematics. I have been fascinated with exact sciences from an early age and Mathematics has always had a special place in my heart. I have participated in numerous Math fairs and competitions. I have represented my elementary school on a national level and was fortunate enough to represent my high school on an international level at the age of 16. I have always been a dedicated and hard-working student and I go great lengths to deliver what is needed from me.</p>
            <p>I am currently learning HTML and CSS and you can check out my progress at:</p>
